This is a data analysis report I created to present my findings after analyzing user trafic data in the Bixi dataset.

Bixi is a bike rental system in Montreal, Canada. After analyzing the user data, I was able to draw business insights and present 
them in a business report. I use SQL to process the data and use Tableau to visulaize the findings.
